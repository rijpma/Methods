# Methods of historical research
Course materials for _Methods of historical research_ (UU).

## General introduction

This course is broken down in two parts. [Part one](#Part 1: Unstructured data) is about the analysis of large text corpora. [Part two](#Part 2: Structured data) is about the quantitative analysis of more traditional datasets.

### Grading
The grade will consist of four parts:

1. Participation in the first half of the course, including the assignments (10%).
2. The paper for the first half of the course (40%).
3. Participation in the second half of the course, including the assignments (10%),
4. The paper for the second half of the course (40%).

To pass the course you must get at least a 5 for both the papers. If the final grade of the course is between a 4 and a 5.5, you may repair the paper for which you got the lowest grade.

### Preparations
Make sure to have R installed beforehand. You can use [the standard R installation](https://www.r-project.org), but many find the [R-studio version](https://www.rstudio.com) pleasant to work with. Either way, try to get it up and running before the first tutorial (Wed. 12), so we can address any issues before the first lab session (Fri. 14). Once you're up and running, have a look at the first videos of [Google's R-intro for beginners](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOU2XLYxmsIK9qQfztXeybpHvru-TrqAP)
