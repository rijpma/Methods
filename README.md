# Methods of historical research

## General introduction

The purpose of this course is to familiarize students of the Research MA programme History with computational techniques to analyse structured and unstructured data. More and more historians are using large sets of digital data as well as a growing variety of digital techniques to extract information from this data. Scholars are discussing the disruptive nature of these increasingly common practices for historical scholarship under the header of Digital Humanities and Digital History. It is not only timely to become acquainted with a number of widely used techniques and skills, but also to learn how to use them for the study of history in a critical and conscientious way. A last goal of this course is to provide students with sufficient information to form their own opinion of the extent to which digital resources and tools change the heuristics of historical enquiry.

In this course students will work with tools for the analysis of unstructured (textual) and structured (numerical) historical data. Students are trained in the analytical tools in a ‘hands on’ setting, in which they work on their own research projects. Students will work in groups on a paper that answersa research question using both types of data. Students will have to reflect in their research projects on the opportunities, but also the risks and pitfalls of digital tools for this type of historical study. More generally, they will evaluate and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of a selection of books, articles, and working papers that employ digital humanities methods with these tools.

## Grading
The grade will consist of two parts:

1. Participation and assignments (20%).
2. The paper for the first half of the course (80%).

To pass the course you must get at least a 5 for the papers. If the final grade of the course is between a 4 and a 5.5, you may repair the paper. Points will be subtracted from the grade if you are late handing in the paper.

## Schedule

### Week 1: 
No classes due to opening academic year.


### Week 2: 

#### Preparations
Make sure to have R installed beforehand. You can use [the standard R installation](https://www.r-project.org), but many find the [R-studio version](https://www.rstudio.com) pleasant to work with. Either way, try to get it up and running before the first tutorial (Wed. 12), so we can address any issues before the first lab session (Fri. 14). Once you're up and running, have a look at the first videos of [Google's R-intro for beginners](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOU2XLYxmsIK9qQfztXeybpHvru-TrqAP)

#### Tutorial: the quantitative approach to history.
* For the first tutorial, every student is to find an interesting paper using quantitative methods and structured data (interesting because of its topic and findings, not necessarily because of the methodology). Please read this article and prepare some discussion points for class. Distribute the article itself tothe group students no later than 17.00 on Sunday.
* Using the articles you brought with you, we will use this session to discuss about the pros and cons of quantitative research. 
* There are no further readings besides the article on which you prepare talking points. You only need to skim the other articles to get a feeling what they are about beforehand. Next week however, there are substantial readings, so it is good to use the time to begin reading Cleveland.

#### Lab session:
Basics of working with data in R.

### Week 3: visualising data

#### Readings
* Cleveland, _The elements of graphing data_ (Monterey 1985), pp. 3--227. Book available on course reserve shelf soon -- please do not reserve it.

#### Tutorial: visualising data
* In this tutorial we will discuss the principles of making a good visualisation.
* As preparation for the session, find a striking visualisation in a journal article or on the internet and distribute it to the group no later than 17.00 on Sunday. Prepare a short introduction of the visualisation and explain what you liked about it. 
* 17.00 on Tuesday before the tutorial.

#### Lab session:
Basic data management and visualisations

### Week 4: Introduction to unstructed data

#### Readings
* Tim Hitchcock, 'Confronting the Digital. Or: How Academic History Writing Lost the Plot', _Cultural and Social History_ 10 (2013), pp. 9-23.

### Week 8
#### Tutorial: evaluating research
In the second tutorial we will discuss how to assess the credibility of quantitative research. Some of the literature is a little technical, but we will try to distill the core insights in the tutorial.

#### Lab session
Further data management and visualisations

#### Assignment
* So far there has been ample attention for working in a reproducible way. For this assignment you will have to hand in all the files necessary to reproduce one of the visualisations of the lab session of week 7.
* Due: Wed. 18th, 17.00.

### Week 9
#### Hand in paper
The paper is a short (3000 words) paper based on a large historical structured dataset (LINKS, to be discussed during tutorials) and unstructured data. The paper is to contain an introduction to the hisotircal issue, an introduction of the data, at least three figures or tables (at least one for each type of data), a methodological reflection, and all the files and scripts you used to obtain your results. 

The paper will be graded on the following (roughly in descending order of importance):

* How you use data to answer historical questions
* The presentation of the results
* Reproducability, 
* Reflection on suitability of data and methodology for the question at hand as well as the comparative strength of both kinds of data for the question. 
* Use of literature and formulation of the research question.

Note that while the classic elements of a historical paper are the least important and can be somewhat contrived, they should however be present and should not be nonsensical. 

The paper should be handed in no later than Friday, October 3rd, 17.00.
