Course materials for _Methods of historical research_ (UU).

## General introduction

This course is broken down in two parts. [Part one](#Part 1: Unstructured data) is about the analysis of large text corpora. [Part two](#Part 2: Structured data) is about the quantitative analysis of more traditional datasets.

### Grading
The grade will consist of four parts:

1. Participation in the first half of the course, including the assignments (10%).
2. The paper for the first half of the course (40%).
3. Participation in the second half of the course, including the assignments (10%),
4. The paper for the second half of the course (40%).

To pass the course you must get at least a 5 for both the papers. If the final grade of the course is between a 4 and a 5.5, you may repair the paper for which you got the lowest grade.
